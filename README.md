# NBA Live Game Event Agent

A LangGraph agent that consumes NBA play-by-play events from Kafka and emits real-time, ESPN-style narrative insights for notable moments.

The agent reasons over each play, decides whether it's worth analyzing, calls tools to enrich it with player stats and momentum data, and produces a 2–3 sentence broadcast-style insight. Routine plays are skipped.

## Why this project

Event-driven agentic systems are an underexplored corner of the LLM-application space. Most agent demos run one-shot off a chat prompt; production agents tend to live behind a queue, reacting to events they didn't ask for. This project builds that pattern end to end on a domain (live sports) where the boundary between "notable" and "noise" is concrete enough to evaluate.

Demo data is the 2016 NBA Finals Game 7 — a high-density game with enough decisive moments (LeBron's chase-down block, Kyrie's go-ahead three, lead changes in the final two minutes) to exercise every branch of the agent's decision logic.

## Architecture

```
Simulated play-by-play (nba_api)
        ↓
   Kafka producer
        ↓
   Kafka topic: nba.plays
        ↓
   Consumer + LangGraph agent ──► MCP subprocess (career profile)
        ↓
   data/insights.jsonl
```

The consumer maintains a stateful `GameContextTracker` keyed by game ID — running score, quarter, time, last five scoring plays, per-player foul counts — folded across the event stream. Before each graph invocation, it attaches a fresh snapshot to the agent state. The graph itself is stateless across events.

At startup the agent spawns a separate MCP subprocess that exposes one tool, `get_player_profile`, for career-level context. The classifier sees it alongside the local tools and decides on its own when to reach for it (see [MCP integration](#mcp-integration) below).

### The agent loop

```
        [START]
           ↓
   ┌──→ classify_event  ← model: skip, call tools, or finalize
   │      ↓        ↓             ↓
   │   tool_calls  plain text    plain text + intent="analyze"
   │      ↓        ↓             ↓
   └── call_tools  [END]         generate_insight (node, LLM call)
       (get_player_stats,           ↓
        analyze_momentum,         send_alert (tool)
        get_player_profile)         ↓
                                  [END]
```

This is an agentic loop, not a fixed pipeline. The model decides which tools to call and in what order. It can gather player stats, look at the last five scoring plays for momentum context, or skip the play outright. When it has enough information, control transfers to a dedicated `generate_insight` node — a separate LLM call optimized for ESPN-voice narrative — and then to `send_alert` to persist the output.

Insight generation is a graph node, not a tool, because tools are reserved for deterministic data fetches and side effects. Wrapping a model call as a "tool" blurs that abstraction.

---

## How the agent decides what's notable

The classifier's system prompt encodes a small set of heuristics:

- A scoring play that extends or cuts a lead to ≤5 points in Q4
- A player hitting a stat milestone in-game (20 pts, 10 reb, 10 ast)
- Three consecutive scoring plays by the same team (a run)
- A foul on a player already at 5 fouls (foul trouble)
- Any event in the final two minutes of Q4 or OT

Routine free throws, substitutions, and early-quarter timeouts are skipped without an LLM tool call beyond classification.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (for Kafka)
- Python 3.12
- An Anthropic API key

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/jaredalonzo/nba-event-agent.git
cd nba-event-agent

# Create venv and install
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment — copy the template and fill in your API key
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (the other defaults are fine)
```

### Run

Three terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: bring Kafka up
docker compose up -d

# Terminal 2: start the agent (consumer)
python -m src.agent

# Terminal 3: start a producer (historical OR live — see below)
python -m src.producer       # historical replay
# python -m src.producer_live  # live polling
```

The agent prints classification decisions in real time and writes notable insights to `data/insights.jsonl`.

#### Two producer modes

| | `src/producer.py` (historical) | `src/producer_live.py` (live) |
|---|---|---|
| **Data source** | `nba_api.stats.endpoints.PlayByPlayV3` | `cdn.nba.com/static/json/liveData/*` |
| **Game selection** | Set `NBA_GAME_ID` to any completed game | If `NBA_GAME_ID` is set: stream that game (must be in progress). If unset: auto-discover the first in-progress game on today's slate |
| **Pacing** | Configurable artificial delay (`PRODUCER_DELAY_SECONDS`) | Poll interval (`LIVE_POLL_SECONDS`, default 5s) — dictated by the game |
| **Duration** | A few minutes (467 events × 0.5s) | A few hours (real game length) |
| **Available when** | Any time | Only during the NBA season, when a game is actually on |

The historical producer is the demo path — works offline, reproducible. The live producer is the real-event-driven version — same agent, same Kafka, same insights pipeline; just a different source of truth.

### Re-running cleanly

The consumer uses `auto.offset.reset=earliest` with `enable.auto.commit=false`, but a stale consumer-group offset will still cause the second run to look like nothing happens. For a fresh replay, change `KAFKA_GROUP_ID` in `.env` or reset offsets:

```bash
docker exec nba-kafka kafka-consumer-groups \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --group "$KAFKA_GROUP_ID" \
  --reset-offsets --to-earliest --topic nba.plays --execute
```

---

## Example output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-20T20:14:11Z",
  "game_id": "0041500407",
  "period": 4,
  "clock": "1:50",
  "event": "LeBron James blocks Andre Iguodala's layup attempt",
  "severity": "critical",
  "insight": "LeBron's chase-down block on Iguodala with under two minutes to play is the kind of defensive play that changes a championship. Cleveland trails by zero — the score's tied at 89 — and James has now logged 27 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists tonight."
}
```

Insights are appended line-by-line to `data/insights.jsonl` and mirrored to stdout.

---

## MCP integration

The agent's career-context tool, `get_player_profile`, lives in a separate process speaking the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) over stdio. The agent spawns it at startup and holds the session open for the run:

```python
mcp_client = MultiServerMCPClient({
    "nba": {
        "command": sys.executable,
        "args": ["-m", "src.mcp_server.server"],
        "transport": "stdio",
    }
})

async with mcp_client.session("nba") as session:
    mcp_tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)
    all_tools = AGENT_TOOLS + mcp_tools
    # bind to the classifier LLM, build the graph, run the consumer loop…
```

Two things worth flagging:

- **Why MCP for this tool specifically.** The local tools in `src/tools.py` operate on the current game — box-score stats, momentum runs, alerts. `get_player_profile` is a different shape: it pulls career-level data that doesn't change mid-game and is worth caching to disk. Moving it behind MCP keeps that long-lived data fetcher (and its cache) cleanly out of the per-event tool surface, and demonstrates the protocol-level integration as a portfolio piece.

- **Persistent session matters.** A re-spawn-per-call setup runs ~570ms per tool invocation (subprocess startup + handshake). Holding the session open via `client.session("nba")` drops that to ~1ms. The MCP subprocess maintains its own in-memory cache mirroring `data/player_profiles.json`, so repeat lookups for the same player are effectively free.

The MCP-bridged tool is async-only — `langchain-mcp-adapters` wraps it as a LangChain `StructuredTool` without sync support. That's why the agent's `main()` and `_process_event` are `async def` and the graph uses `ainvoke`; the Kafka consumer's blocking `poll` is dispatched to a thread executor so the event loop stays free.

---

## Roadmap

Beyond the current scope:

- ~~Swap simulated play-by-play for a live WebSocket feed~~ — done as polling against `cdn.nba.com/static/json/liveData/*` (see `src/producer_live.py`)
- ~~Add an MCP server tool (`get_player_profile`) to demonstrate MCP + LangGraph integration~~ — done
- LangSmith tracing for observability
- FastAPI endpoint exposing the insight stream
- PostgreSQL persistence for raw plays + agent decisions (see [JAR-8](https://linear.app/jared-alonzo/issue/JAR-8/feat-store-play-by-play-data-to-postgresql))
- ~~Apache Flink as a stream processing layer~~ — evaluated and deferred; LLM latency is the bottleneck, not throughput. Worth revisiting at 10+ simultaneous games or if the project moves to the JVM.
